This project was done for participating in Kaggle competition organized by Kaspi.kz. 
The inout data does not have any missing values and alot of outliers according to the provider.
The competition was focusing on evluating the skills of creating different models. 
The only condition for the competition is to not have salary more that 1000000 in the submission file.
In this project I used Simple Linear Regression and Catboost regression.
